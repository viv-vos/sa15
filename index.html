                <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
                <h4>Estimated Time: 55  minutes </h4>
                <ul>
    
                      <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
                      <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                      <li>2/3 cup cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy</li>
                      <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted if lumpy</li>
                      <li>1/2 cup dark chocolate chips</li>
                      <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
                      <li>3/4 teaspoons sea salt</li>
                      <li>2 large eggs</li>
                      <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
                      <li>1/2 cup canola oil or extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                </ul>
          
                <h4>Steps:</h4>
                <p>
                    <ol type="1">
                      <li> Preheat the oven to 325°F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish (not a 9x9 dish or your brownies will overcook) with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.
                      <li>In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.</li>
                      <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.</li> 
                      <li>Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.</li> 
                      <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long). Cool completely before slicing.*** Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. These also freeze well!</li>

                <ul>
    
                      <li>1/2 cup sugar </li>
                      <li>1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder    </li>
                      <li>3 Tbsp cornstarch</li>
                      <li>2 cups half and half</li>

                    <ol type="1">
                      <li> Add the sugar, cocoa powder, and cornstarch to a small sauce pot and stir to combine.                </li>
                      <li>Add the half and half and vanilla extract to the sauce pot. Place the pot over medium heat and begin to whisk everything together. The cocoa will repel the liquid at first, but as the half and half begins to warm, they will come together. </li>
                      <li>Continue to heat the mixture while whisking until it comes to a gentle simmer, at which point it will thicken into a pudding. Remove the pudding from the heat.                </li> 
                      <li>Serve the chocolate pudding warm, or refrigerate until cool. To refrigerate, place a layer or plastic wrap or parchment on the surface of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming on top.
                    </li>
